About
============
Do you want to create dynamic product tabs? Currently, in odoo, you can't create dynamic custom tabs in the product. This module is useful to create and add a dynamic tab in any product without any technical knowledge. You have 5+ attractive styles to present tabs. You can create many tabs in each product. You can modify the created product tabs. Admin can active/deactivate product tabs easily. cheers!
